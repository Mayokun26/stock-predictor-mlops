# CLAUDE.md - Enterprise-Grade MLOps Stock Prediction System

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working on the stock market prediction MLOps system. This is a **career transition project** from DevOps to MLOps.

## PROJECT STRATEGY UPDATE - PRODUCTION-GRADE SYSTEM

**STRATEGIC DECISION**: Build enterprise-grade MLOps system immediately rather than incremental MVP approach.

**Rationale**: 
- Target salary ($300k+) requires production-level expertise demonstration
- Better ROI: 2 weeks extra development vs $25-75k salary increase potential
- Market differentiation from other DevOps→MLOps transitions
- Demonstrates immediate senior-level contribution capability

**Primary Goal**: Build a production-ready MLOps system that predicts stock prices using comprehensive feature engineering, sentiment analysis, and enterprise monitoring stack.

**Career Objective**: Demonstrate advanced MLOps competencies to land $300k+ MLOps role within 3-6 months.

**Current Status**: **ENTERPRISE SYSTEM COMPLETED & MIGRATED TO WSL** - Production-grade MLOps system fully operational on WSL native filesystem with performance optimizations. All 11 API endpoints working without external dependencies.

**Important**: This is a portfolio project for career transition. Do NOT include Claude attribution in commits to maintain professional appearance and demonstrate independent technical competency.

### Learning Approach - REVISED FOR COMPLEXITY MANAGEMENT

**IMPORTANT ACKNOWLEDGMENT**: The production system is enterprise-grade complex. Learning requires careful pacing and explanation.

**Deep End Learning Strategy ($300k Target):**
1. **Build Production System First**: Complete enterprise-grade system architecture
2. **Learn Through Deployment**: Understand components by deploying and troubleshooting them

for year in range(1980, 2024):
    # Train on data from 1980 to current year
    train_data = get_data(1980, year)
    model = train_model(train_data)
    
    # Test on next year
    test_data = get_data(year + 1, year + 1)
    predictions = model.predict(test_data)
    
    # Evaluate performance
    performance = evaluate_predictions(predictions, test_data.actual)
    
    # Track model degradation over time
    track_model_drift(performance, year)
```

**Benefits for Skills Demonstration**:
- Shows understanding of temporal data challenges

## IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

### Time Constraints
- 3-6 month deadline for MLOps job transition
- Currently working 3 DevOps jobs - limited time for learning
- Must balance with finishing TheRoundTable portfolio piece

### Technical Constraints
- Learning curve: New to ML model operations
- Infrastructure: Leverage existing DevOps skills
- Budget: Use free/cheap services where possible

### Career Constraints
- No formal ML education: Need to demonstrate practical skills
- Degree issue: Focus on practical demonstration over credentials
- Job market: Must differentiate from other DevOps-to-MLOps transitions

### Communication Tone - BRUTALLY HONEST APPROACH
- **Minimal Delusion, Maximum Focus**: Avoid overly optimistic language about career outcomes
- **No Salary References**: Stop mentioning "$300k" or salary projections - focus on technical competency
- **Direct Technical Communication**: Explain what works, what doesn't, next steps
- **Realistic Assessment**: Building enterprise systems is inherently difficult and time-consuming
- **Professional Approach**: This is a learning project, not a guaranteed career outcome

### **What This Project Will NOT Do**
- Guarantee a $250k job (nothing will in this market)
- Replace actual ML experience at scale
- Compete with candidates who have 5+ years at FAANG doing production ML
- Overcome degree/pedigree gaps for most conservative employers
- Solve the fundamental oversaturation in AI/ML job market

### **What This Project MIGHT Do**
- Get you past initial technical screens (15-25% improvement in callback rates)
- Give you concrete examples for behavioral interviews
- Demonstrate you understand MLOps concepts beyond basic DevOps
- Differentiate you from other DevOps→MLOps transitions
- Provide talking points that show production-level thinking

### **Market Reality Check**
Even brilliant engineers with advanced degrees are struggling in current market conditions:
- 500+ applications per ML role is common
- Preference for proven experience over potential
- Economic uncertainty making hiring extremely conservative  
- AI hype creating oversaturated candidate pool
- Companies can be extremely picky

### **Realistic Timeline Assessment**
**With AI assistance doing majority of coding**:
- **2-4 weeks** for impressive technical demo
- **4-8 weeks additional** for you to deeply understand and explain it
- **2-3 months total** before you can interview confidently about implementation details

**Solo development timeline**: 6-12 months of focused work

## AGGRESSIVE MLOPS TRANSITION STRATEGY

**Current State**: 4 years successful senior-level fabrication, $360k income across 3 DevOps roles. Proven ability to perform at fabricated levels.

**Target**: $250k+ Senior MLOps Engineer roles within 30 days using this project as technical proof.

**Strategy**: Full senior-level positioning. No defensive "transitioning" narrative. Maintain existing fabrication approach that has proven successful.

### **Core Approach**
- Position as experienced Senior MLOps Engineer with recent focus on financial ML
- Use this project as proof of current "production work"
- Keep fabricated degree and timeline (proven successful for 4 years)
- Target highest-paying roles immediately ($250-350k range)

### **Success Probability**: 35-45%
**Advantages**: Proven fabrication track record, real DevOps skills transfer, hot MLOps market, technical project backing
**Risks**: Competitive market, technical depth requirements

## THREE-DAY SPRINT EXECUTION

**Goal**: Production-grade MLOps system supporting senior engineer narrative in 6-9 total hours

### **Day 1: System Stabilization** (2-3 hours)
- Fix linting errors and CI/CD pipeline
- Ensure all services run locally without errors
- Clean production-ready API documentation

### **Day 2: Core ML Features** (2-3 hours) 
- Implement backtesting engine with historical stock data
- Add financial evaluation metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, ROI)
- Enhance model evaluation and comparison framework

### **Day 3: Senior-Level Polish** (2-3 hours)
- Advanced monitoring dashboard setup
- Production-grade error handling and logging
- Performance optimization and load testing prep
- Documentation polish for "enterprise production system"

## MODEL EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

### Production Evaluation Pipeline
```python
# Custom evaluation framework with business metrics
class ModelEvaluator:
    def evaluate_model(self, model, test_data):
        # Statistical metrics
        rmse = calculate_rmse(predictions, actuals)
        mae = calculate_mae(predictions, actuals)
        r2 = calculate_r2(predictions, actuals)
        
        # Business metrics  
        roi = calculate_trading_roi(predictions, actuals, prices)
        sharpe_ratio = calculate_sharpe_ratio(returns)
        max_drawdown = calculate_max_drawdown(returns)
        
        # Statistical significance testing for A/B comparisons
        significance = statistical_significance_test(model_a, model_b)
        
        return EvaluationReport(statistical=stats, business=business, significance=sig)
```

### A/B Testing Framework
- **Champion/Challenger Pattern**: Always maintain production champion model
- **Traffic Splitting**: Route prediction requests to different model versions
- **Statistical Significance**: Proper hypothesis testing for model comparison
- **Business Impact Tracking**: ROI and risk-adjusted performance metrics
- **Automated Rollback**: Performance degradation triggers automatic fallback

### Data Drift Detection
```python
# Real-time drift monitoring
class DriftDetector:
    def detect_feature_drift(self, reference_data, current_data):
        # Statistical tests for distribution changes
        ks_statistic = kolmogorov_smirnov_test(reference, current)
        psi_score = population_stability_index(reference, current)
        
        # Alert if drift detected
        if psi_score > 0.25:  # Industry threshold
            trigger_drift_alert()
            schedule_model_retraining()
```
